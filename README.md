# elevate-lab-SQL-Task-3


 My SQL Task FOR SQL INTERNSHIP (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT)
 
So here’s what I did in this SQL task using the guests table from my hotel_management database:

 What I Worked On:
I started with simple SELECT * to see all data.

Then I selected specific columns like guest name, email, city etc.

I applied filters using WHERE, AND, OR, LIKE, and BETWEEN to get targeted results (like Gmail users, people from Delhi, names starting with A, and guests in an age range).

I sorted the data using ORDER BY, both ASC and DESC.

I also used LIMIT to show only top records (like top 5 oldest guests, or first 3 names alphabetically).

In some cases, I combined everything (WHERE + ORDER BY + LIMIT) to show smart queries like “Top 2 Gmail users from Delhi sorted by age.”

 What This Shows:
I know how to extract and cleanly present data using basic and advanced SELECT queries.

I can think practically — like what a hotel manager or system would actually need.

My queries are readable, structured, and easy to reuse.
